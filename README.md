# hello-world

Counting Bricks is a joke about my profession - quantity surveyor, having been called (affectionately, of course) a 'bean counter' or being told 'all you do is count bricks'... Counting Bricks is about the best I could come up with!

I have no end goal for Counting Bricks right now and I like that.   

All I have is a lot of thoughts on the built environment and I want to give myself a platform to explore my thoughts and develop my passion for the built environment beyond the wee bean counting pigeon hole in which the quantity surveyor is often placed.

Hopefully I learn new skills and with a bit of luck contribute something somewhat interesting and hopefully worthwhile.

All the best.
